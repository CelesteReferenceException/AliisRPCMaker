## About
This is my first project using technologies like typescript and electron so it is very likely that the code is not very consistent, I accept any suggestion as long as it is not with the intention of implementing personal practices or to correct things when it is not necessary.

Btw, "**Windows has protected your PC**" it's just Windows Defender being silly, you can always check the source code to find out how the app works!
