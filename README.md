# AliisRPCMaker
The best way to customize your [Discord](https://discord.com) profile!

**_The development of the project has been stopped._** It's been a long time since I last worked on the project and my opinion on it has changed. Although it has potential, it is not my priority right now and there are things that can be done better. My initial idea was to give a modern and simple tool to Discord users to change the profile on a whim, without significantly affecting performance. But I haven't made the best choice of tools and my motivation is not the same. Maybe I'll work on this project again in the future. Previous versions will remain available and the repository will remain in a read-only state.

~~_This project is currently in a beta state so bugs are more likely, if you want to contribute to the project you are more than welcome to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hP23XgU6RW)!_~~

# How to Support

This project is not for profit, however if you want to support in some way you can always give the repository a star!

## About
This is my first project using technologies like typescript and electron so it is very likely that the code is not very consistent, I accept any suggestion as long as it is not with the intention of implementing personal practices or to correct things when it is not necessary.

Btw, "**Windows has protected your PC**" it's just Windows Defender being silly, you can always check the source code to find out how the app works!
